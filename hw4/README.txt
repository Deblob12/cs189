Reproduction instructions:
- Make sure the required libraries that are imported are installed. I did so in a conda env.
- In the env, run "jupyter lab" or "jupyter notebook" in the same folder as the .ipynb file. Either command should work, but I did the former. 
- As required, all the code is put in an appendix, which in my case means all the code is in a single cell at the very end. Since the appendix code is spread throughout the rest of the notebook, no need to run it (I didn't).
- Note: In 4.4, I did hyperparameter tuning in one cell, and so unlike other cells that run instantly, said cell might take a few minutes (took me roughly 3.5 minutes). I also modified the save_csv.py file to name Kaggle prediction files in a way that makes more sense to me. I didn't include the check.py file since I didn't use it.
