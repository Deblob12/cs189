- Note: I had to change the "open" function call in create_design_matrix in featurize.py because I got a "UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xa9 in position 1054: invalid start byte" error. Thus I change the open function call to use a different encoding: open(filename, encoding="latin-1")
- besides the libraries used in the already provided code, make sure to have sklearn, nltk, and ray installed
- go to datasets/spam-dataset/ and run "python featurize.py". Make sure your files directory looks like the one in the provided photo in the submission labeled "directory"
